My project is a tracking sheet for Computer Science majors. Users can log in and create a tracking sheet that will save their computer science courses in a database. 
They are able to add, delete, and edit courses. I made some new CSS compared to assignment 3 and converted everything to React friendly using useStates and useEffects.
